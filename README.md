# Task-Fragmentation
AN assignment to test the fragmentation ability of Developers

My Pick - Fragment the UI into selective components to make it more readable

## My Reasons for Fragmentating it like that

Write down your reasons here.
Fragmenting the UI into smaller, more manageable components has several advantages:

Reusability: Smaller components can be reused in other parts of the application, reducing the need to rewrite similar code.

Maintainability: Splitting the UI into separate components makes it easier to maintain and update since changes can be made to individual components without affecting the entire application.

Readability: Smaller components break down the code into more digestible pieces, making it easier to read, understand, and follow the code flow.

Testability: Each component can be individually tested, which simplifies the testing process and ensures the correct functionality of each component.

Collaboration: Smaller components make it easier for developers to work together, as they can focus on specific parts of the application, reducing conflicts and potential errors.

Performance: React benefits from smaller components, as they can be re-rendered without affecting the entire application, leading to improved performance and less layout thrashing.

Scalability: Fragmenting the UI into smaller components makes it more comfortable to scale and extend the application, as new components can be created and integrated more seamlessly.

In the given example, we broke down the BurnPage component into smaller components, such as BurnButtonBar, BurnStatsContainer, SupplyBar, and SupplyLabelList. This approach makes the code easier to read, maintain, and update, while also making it more reusable and scalable.
